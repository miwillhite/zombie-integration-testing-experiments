What's left to figure out:


Figure out how to run tests in parallel, take advantage of the async vows

Shared steps (like Background)

Needs to initiate it's own instance of the app...could have a gem wrapper that fires up a test env

Do I need to look at database interactions? or leave that out and focus strictly on client

Establish directory structure

Need to run all files in one go

Solidify ajax testing (currently stubbing $.ajax...would be nice to stub out the response instead)
